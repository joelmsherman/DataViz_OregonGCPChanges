# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 40
**Local Area GDP - A Look at Oregon Counties Since the Great Recession**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 40 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w40-the-us-cities-with-the-highest-economic-output) showing local-area Gross-Metropolitan Product (GMP) for major US metro areas.

## Data Source
Data comes from the BEA [here](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-county-metro-and-other-areas), however, the dataset referenced here by Makeover Monday staff are actually local-area GDP estimates for counties, not metros.  I use county in my visualization, as prescribed.  

## My Approach for Week 38
The original viz is a 3D map showing pile charts for each major US metro area.  My visualization chooses to focus on Oregon counties, and look at changes in GCP since the Great Recession, focusing on a few counties in Oregon that've seen net declines in their economies over the last 8 years.
